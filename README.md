The scope of this application was to be familiar with how to use MERN stack and CRUD while building a full stack web application.

## The functionality of The App:
This app is similar to Google Keep.\
Users can add notes as many as they wanted.\
They can delete the notes that are taken.\

## What I Have Used
For the backend server environment, I used Node.js with Express.js framework to design application layer.\
For the persistence of data, I used MongoDB as my database to store user's notes.\
A note schema holds title and content fields.\
For the frontend i used React.js library to design the client side of the application.\
React hooks especially useState, useEffect and useRef are used to increase effectiveness of the application through maintaining(useState), refreshing(useEffect) and reassigning(useRef) amongst component states.\


## To Use Locally

```bash
Clone local branch\
Run 'npm install' in frontend folder.\
Run 'npm install' in root folder.\
Run 'nodemon server.js' in root folder.\
Run 'npm start' in frontend folder. 
```
